# react-resize-aware

A simple React.js component you can use to make any piece of UI aware of its size.

Each time the component changes its size (it can be due to a window resize, a CSS change, a JS action, etc...)
a `resize` event will be fired on the component itself.

You can then listen to such event to perform any kind of operation.

It requires just React.js and ReactDOM.
